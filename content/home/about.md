# About me

I am a young, dynamic and agile independent consultant who is very passionate to apply health informatics in healthcare, research and biomedicine. My overall career objective is to solve problems and to get work done in the most efficient and effective way.

I have a proven knowledge and working experience with open source technologies for health in low and middle income countries (LMICs). This includes but not limited to DHIS2, OpenMRS and OpenHIM. I currently consult for Population Services International (PSI) in the role of DHIS2 Junior Consultant.
